## Gemini API Key (Bring Your Own Key)

HomePre supports **Gemini API Key only**. Other providers or key types are **not supported**.

### What is this for?
If you have Premium access, you can use **Bring Your Own Key** mode to send generation requests using your own Gemini API key.

### How to use
1. Get a **Gemini API key** from Google (Gemini).
2. Open HomePre → go to the settings panel for generation.
3. Enable **Bring Your Own Key** (Premium required).
4. Paste your **Gemini API key** and save.
5. Run generation again.

### Credits & billing
- In **Key mode**, HomePre **does not deduct credits**.
- Any usage cost/limits are handled by **your Gemini account**.

### Security & storage
- Your Gemini API key is stored **locally on your device** using the **iOS Keychain**.
- Do not share your key. If you believe it’s compromised, revoke/regenerate it in your Gemini/Google console.

### Troubleshooting
- “Invalid API key”: verify the key is correct and active.
- “Request failed” / “Quota exceeded”: check your Gemini account quota/billing/limits.
- Still stuck: remove the key, restart the app, then add it again.
