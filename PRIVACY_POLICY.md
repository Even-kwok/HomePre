# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** December 14, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how **HomePre** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects information when you use our mobile application (the "**App**") and related services (collectively, the "**Service**").

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service.

---

## 1) Summary (plain language)

- We provide an AI-powered home/interior design experience.
- To generate designs, we process **photos/images you choose** and the **prompts/instructions** you enter.
- We use service providers to operate the Service (for example **Supabase** for authentication/database and **cloud hosting** for our API).
- In-app purchases (such as Premium unlocks and credit top-ups) are processed by **Apple (App Store / StoreKit)**. We do not receive your full payment card details.
- If you choose to use **Bring Your Own Key** mode for Gemini, your Gemini API key is stored locally in the **iOS Keychain** on your device.

---

## 2) Information we collect

### A. Information you provide

- **Account information**: such as email address, password, and profile information you choose to provide (e.g., name, avatar) when you sign up or sign in.
- **Authentication data**: when you sign in with Apple, we receive identifiers/tokens necessary to authenticate you.
- **User content**:
  - **Images/photos** you select or capture for design generation.
  - **Text prompts** and instructions you type.
  - **Generated outputs** (e.g., generated images) associated with your account or device.
- **Support communications**: information you provide when you contact us for support.

### B. Information collected automatically

- **Device and app information**: basic device/app information necessary to operate the Service (e.g., device type, iOS version, app version) and error logs if a failure occurs.

> Note: The App does not appear to include third‑party analytics SDKs (such as Firebase/Amplitude/Mixpanel) at this time. If we add analytics later, we will update this policy.

### C. Purchases (Premium + credits)

- If you purchase Premium features and/or credit top-ups, **Apple processes the transaction**. We may receive **purchase status** and **entitlement information** to provide access and fulfill credits.

### D. Bring Your Own Key (Gemini API key)

- If you enable Bring Your Own Key, you may enter a **Gemini API key**.
- The key is stored **locally on your device** using the **iOS Keychain**.
- When you use direct Gemini requests, the key is used to send requests to Google’s Gemini API endpoints.

---

## 3) How we use information

We use information to:

- **Provide and operate** the Service (create accounts, sign in, maintain sessions).
- **Generate AI results** based on your selected images and prompts.
- **Store your in-app history and templates** so you can access previous generations and custom styles.
- **Process purchases and restore purchases** (verify entitlements and unlock features).
- **Improve reliability and security** (debugging, fraud prevention, and protecting the Service).
- **Communicate with you** (support requests and important notices).

---

## 4) How we share information

We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information with:

- **Service providers (processors)** that help us run the Service, such as:
  - **Supabase** (authentication, database, and server functions).
  - **Cloud hosting / API infrastructure** (to host our backend API endpoints).
  - **AI providers** (directly or via our backend) to perform AI processing you request.
- **Apple** for App Store purchases and entitlement verification.
- **Legal and safety**: if required by law, or to protect rights, safety, and security.

---

## 5) AI processing details

When you request AI generation or analysis, your selected **images** and **prompts** may be transmitted to our servers and/or AI service providers to produce results.

- We use these inputs **only** to provide the AI features you request.
- AI outputs may be stored to enable in-app history and re-generation features.

---

## 6) Data storage & retention

- **On-device storage**: The App may store certain data locally on your device (e.g., settings, cached images, generation history) so you can view them later.
- **Server-side storage**: Account information and feature state (e.g., credit balance / Premium status) may be stored on our servers (e.g., via Supabase). If AI requests require server processing, relevant data may be stored temporarily to provide and secure the Service.

We retain personal information only as long as needed for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law.

---

## 7) Your choices & rights

Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal information.

### Account deletion

If the App provides an account deletion option, you can use it. You can also request deletion by contacting us. When you delete your account, we will take reasonable steps to delete your personal information from our systems, subject to legal requirements and legitimate business needs.

### Device permissions

- **Camera**: used only when you choose to capture a photo for generation.
- **Photos**: used only when you choose to save generated results to your photo library.

You can change permissions at any time in iOS Settings.

---

## 8) Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

---

## 9) Children’s privacy

The Service is not intended for children under 13 (or a higher age where required by law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 10) International transfers

Your information may be processed in countries other than where you live, including where our service providers operate. We take steps designed to ensure appropriate protection when transferring data.

---

## 11) Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version on this page and update the effective date.
